# What about the iPhone?

Early on we recognized the importance of supporting the iPhone.
However, we have extremely limited development resources,
and so had to start with either iPhone or Android. We chose Android.

iPhone users stay with me here...


# Android update

Back in June we started work on a stripped-down version of the App
for Android.
The stripped-down version would use less battery power because instead of
*pinging* the server, the app would wait for the user to press the
<a

  style='background-color: #216d99; padding-left: .5em; padding-right:
  .5em; color: #ffffff;'>Check</span></a> button.
As mentioned in a previous post, this changes the dynamic of the app.
Instead of being surprised by what’s there, you now have to be
curious about what’s there.

# HTML5 Geolocation to the rescue

While we were developing this new version we realized that many
phones now support the HTML5 Geolocation features, in particular, the
iPhone.

So... maybe you don't need a special version of the app
running on your phone. Maybe all you need is a web browser.

# *App*-ti-tude - a natural ability to do something

Our focus shifted.

We stopped working (for now) on the stripped-down version of the
Android app. Why? Because if you don't need an app for the iPhone,
then maybe you don't need an app for Android phones either.

Maybe all you need is a browser.

# Any browser will do

It looks like, yes, any Geolocation-enhanced browser will do.

Try it yourself:

(The link works with Android phones, too -- if you have a
Geolocation-enhanced browser.)

# Limitations

The HTML5 Geolocation libraries do not appear to be as responsive or
as accurate as the native Android app, but so far that seems not to
be a problem.

The plnkx 'app' is currently in BETA release.

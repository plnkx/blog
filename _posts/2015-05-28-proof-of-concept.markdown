# Hiking in Spain

What do you do when your spouse plans a week-long trek through Spain
with her friends? See if she can test your **plnkx** app, of
course.


# Rick Steves the Travel Guy

One possible use-case for plnkx is travel.
[Rick Steves](http://www.ricksteves.com/about-rick)
is a European travel expert, guidebook author, and TV
travel host. Hence the name for this proof-of-concept.

<br />
Not Rick Steves
</div>

For example, there's a park near the base of the Grand Coulee Dam.
But when does the visitor center up on the hill close? You can google
for the visitor center's web page and click around looking for
hours-of-operation, but what if it was easier to just *plnkx it*?
That is, click the plnkx button to see what's there.

Or suppose you're in Seattle down at Pike Place Market. What's going
on?

Or in Bangkok wondering if pick-pockets are on the loose.

Any travelers from the States staying in your hotel? Sitting at the
bar?

So yes they may be lot's of possible travel-related uses,
but what about posting a note *to* Spain *from* Seattle?

# Seattle to Spain

**Rick Steves' Europe Inc.** publishes dozens of travel books, and updates
them when practical. But wouldn't it be great if the information could
be made available almost immediately?

That's what I wanted to find out.

# The Test

So the test was this. Sit in Seattle, post a plnkx note, and
wait for my wife to find it, real-time, in Spain. If it works, then
that's timely information at your fingertips. That's location-based,
digital *post-anywhere-notes*. That's plnkx.


# The Note

I knew they'd be at a certain hotel in a few days. So I googled their
hotel, [figured
out](http://plnkx.com/wv/find_coordinates_of_location.html) the GPS
coordinates, and looked for something interesting to say.

Here's what I said: "The city is particularly attractive to retired
people, many of whom come to settle there from other areas across
France."

I was trying to be funny.

And this really would be a test. Why? Because the day before I noticed
a problem.


# A Problem?

In France, she posted a note. But when I clicked on the coordinates
in the note, it took me back to where they landed in London. That is,
the message didn't match the location.

Uh oh.

Plnkx has never been to Spain before. Does GPS work the same in
Europe? Is the app caching the coordinates? Does it work
at all? How would we know?

# The Proof

My guess was the coordinates were getting cached in the app.
That's supposed to be a feature, but if you save a new note before
new coordinates are obtained, then your note is saved at your previous
location.

Theory aside, the way to find out was to try it. So I
posted [a note](http://link2.plnkx.com/id/33d3158a80b7de1269932cada1438157a27049e6)
and waited.

What could go wrong?

Five days later, half-way around the world, they arrived at the hotel.
But of course I had no way of knowing.

Until I got this email:

<div style="padding: .5em .5em .5em 1em; margin: 1em;
     border: 1px solid #cccccc;
     background-color: #ffffff; font-family: sans, Arial;" >

<div style='float: right; margin-right: 1em;'>[05/27/2015]</div>

Just noticed your note from the hotel park Victoria.<br />
Ha ha.  I'll share.<br />
<br />

Gorgeous hike today. 14 km.
Not too much uphill cause they took us up by bus.<br />
Lots of downhill. Sore feet.

The plnkx app is currently in BETA release.

But it *works*!

What else can it do?

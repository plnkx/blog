# Hiking in Spain

What do you do when your spouse plans a week-long trek through Spain
with her friends? See if she can test your **plnkx** app, of
course.


# Rick Steves the Travel Guy

One group of people who might find plnkx useful are tourists.
[Rick Steves](http://www.ricksteves.com/about-rick)
is a well known tourist -- a European travel expert, guidebook
author, and TV travel host. That's why this use-case is called the
'Rick Steves'.

Not Rick Steves<br />
<div style='font-size: 8pt; text-align: right;'>
One-hundred, ninety pound nut and bolt, one of 16 used to join
sections of the generator shaft of a 75,000 kW generator - Grand
Coulee Dam, 1942</div>
</div>

For example.

There's a park near the base of the [Grand Coulee
Dam](http://www.usbr.gov/pn/grandcoulee/history/index.html). A short
walk up the hill is a visitor center. When does the visitor center close?

You can google for a web site and click around looking for
hours-of-operation, but what if it was easier to just *plnkx it*?
That is, click the plnkx button to see what's there.

Or suppose you're in downtown Seattle near Pike Place Market. Is there
anything going on that might not have made it into the travel
brochures?

Perhaps you're attending a festival in Bangkok. Are the pick-pockets
on the loose?

Visiting Europe: Any travelers from the States staying in your hotel?
Sitting at the bar? They just might post a quick note, hoping you'll
say hello.

But what if you have information to share and you can't be there in
person? For example, suppose you want to post a note *to* Spain
*from* Seattle.

# Seattle to Spain

**Rick Steves' Europe Inc.** publishes dozens of travel books,
and updates them when practical. But wouldn't it be great if the
information could be updated almost immediately?

That's what I wanted to find out.

# The Test

So the test was this. Sit in Seattle, post a plnkx note, and
wait for my wife to find it, real-time, in Spain. If it works, then
that's timely information at your fingertips. That's location-based,
digital *post-anywhere-notes*. That's plnkx.


# The Note

I had their itinerary so I knew they'd be at a certain hotel in a few
days. I googled the hotel,
[found](http://plnkx.com/wv/find_coordinates_of_location.html) the
GPS coordinates, then looked for a curious fact or something
interesting to say.

Here's what I found: "The city is particularly attractive to retired
people, many of whom come to settle there from other areas across
France."

I was trying to be funny.

And this really would be a test. Why? Because the day before I had
noticed a problem.


# A Problem?

In France, she posted a note. But when I clicked on the coordinates
in the note, it took me back to where they landed in London. That is,
the message didn't match the location.

Uh oh.

Plnkx has never been to Spain before. Does GPS work the same in
Europe? Is the app caching the coordinates? Does it work
at all? How would we know?

# The Proof

My guess was the coordinates were getting cached in the app. That is,
if you save a new note before new coordinates are obtained, then your
new note is saved at your old location.

Theory aside, the way to find out was to try it. So I
posted [a note](http://link2.plnkx.com/id/33d3158a80b7de1269932cada1438157a27049e6),
and waited.


Five days later, half-way around the world, they arrived at the hotel.
But of course I had no way of knowing.

Until I got this email:

<div style="padding: .5em .5em .5em 1em; margin: 1em;
     border: 1px solid #cccccc;
     background-color: #ffffff; font-family: sans, Arial;" >

<div style='float: right; margin-right: 1em;'>[05/27/2015]</div>

Just noticed your note from the hotel park Victoria.<br />
Ha ha.  I'll share.<br />
<br />

Gorgeous hike today. 14 km.
Not too much uphill cause they took us up by bus.<br />
Lots of downhill. Sore feet.
</div>

So it *worked*!

The plnkx app is currently in BETA release.

What else can it do?

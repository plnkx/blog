# Walking &amp; Hiking through Spain

What do you do when your spouse and friends are planning to take a
week-long trek through Spain? Ask them to be **plnkx** beta-testers, of
course.


# The 'Rick Steves' Proof-of-concept

One use-case for plnkx is what I call the '[Rick
Steves](http://www.ricksteves.com/about-rick)'. Rick Steves is a
guidebook author, travel TV host, and respected authority on European
travel.

There are obvious examples of location-specfic information that would
be helpful to travelers. Imagine, for example, approaching a
gallery or museum and using the plnkx app to find out where you can
park or how late they're open.

Or maybe you're standing at the
base of the Statue of Liberty, looking up at her crown. Did you know
the seven spikes on her crown represent the seven oceans and the
seven continents of the world? The idea was to represent the
universal concept of liberty.

So yes, there are lots of uses.

But what about posting a note *to* Spain *from* Seattle?

# Seattle to Spain

**Rick Steves' Europe Inc.** publishes dozens of travel books, and updates
them when practical. But wouldn't it be great if the information could
be made available almost immediately?

That's what I wanted to find out.

# The Test

So the test was this. Sit in Seattle, post a plnkx note to Spain, and
have some one stumble upon it, real-time, in Span. If it works, then
that's timely information at your fingertips.


# The Note

I knew the plnkx beta-testers would be at a certain hotel in a few
days. So I googled the hotel, [figured
out](http://plnkx.com/wv/find_coordinates_of_location.html) the GPS
coordinates, and looked for something interesting to say.

I found this on Wikipedia: "The city is particularly attractive
to retired people, many of whom come to settle there from other areas
across France."

I was trying to be funny.

And this was truly a test. How so? One of the posts said they were in
France, but when I clicked on the coordinates in the note, it took me
back to London Heathrow Airport. Does GPS not work in Spain? Are the
coordinates getting cached? No one has ever been to Spain with plnkx
before. How would we know?

#Poof-of-concept

We'd know by trying it out.

So I posted the note (you can see it
[here](http://link2.plnkx.com/id/33d3158a80b7de1269932cada1438157a27049e6))
and waited.

Nothing happened until the day they arrived. Then I got this email:

<div style='padding: 1em; margin: 1em 2em 1em 4em;
     background-color: #c3d2d8; font-family: sans, Arial;'>

<div style='float: right;'>[05/27/2015]</div>

Just noticed your note from the hotel park Victoria. Ha ha.<br />
I'll share. Thought it was something I had written until I opened
it. <br /><br />

Gorgeous hike today. 14 km.<br />
Not too much uphill cause they took us up by bus.<br />
Lots of downhill.
Sore feet.<br /><br />

Miss you.  Xo

It *works*!


The plnkx app is currently in BETA release.

# Walking &amp; Hiking through Spain

What do you do when your spouse and friends are planning to take a
week-long trek through Spain? Ask them to be **plnkx** beta-testers, of
course.


# The 'Rick Steves' Proof-of-concept

One use-case for plnkx is what I call the '[Rick
Steves](http://www.ricksteves.com/about-rick)'. Rick Steves is a
European travel expert, guidebook author, and TV travel host.

This use-case is related to travel. Hence the name.

There are obvious examples of location-specfic information that would
be helpful to travelers. Imagine, for example, approaching a
gallery or museum and using the plnkx app to find out where you can
park or how late they're open.

Or maybe you're standing at the foot of the Statue of Liberty,
looking up at her crown. Did you know the seven spikes on her crown
represent the seven oceans and the seven continents of the world? The
idea was to represent the universal concept of liberty.

Or maybe you walk down to Pike Place Market in Seattle and want to
know what's going on right there right now. Or maybe you're wondering
if the pick-pockets are on the loose in Bangkok? Or if there are fellow
travelers from your country also visiting in the area, or staying at
hotel, or sitting in the bar!

So yes, there are lots of use-cases for travel.

But what about posting a note *to* Spain *from* Seattle?

# Seattle to Spain

**Rick Steves' Europe Inc.** publishes dozens of travel books, and updates
them when practical. But wouldn't it be great if the information could
be made available almost immediately?

That's what I wanted to find out.

# The Test

So the test was this. Sit in Seattle, post a plnkx note to Spain, and
wait for someone to find it, real-time, in Spain. If it works,
then that's timely information at your fingertips. That's
location-based, digital *post-anywhere-notes*. That's plnkx.


# The Note

I knew the plnkx beta-testers would be at a certain hotel in a few
days. So I googled the hotel, [figured
out](http://plnkx.com/wv/find_coordinates_of_location.html) the GPS
coordinates, and looked for something interesting to say.

Here's what I said: "The city is particularly attractive to retired
people, many of whom come to settle there from other areas across
France."

I was trying to be funny.

And this truly would be a test. Why? Because the day before I noticed
a problem.


# A Problem?

While in France, one of the crew posted a note. But when I clicked on
the coordinates referenced in the note, it took me back to their
airport in London. That is, the message didn't match the location.

Uh oh.

Does GPS work the same way in Europe? Are the coordinates getting
cached in the app? No one has been to Spain with plnkx before. Does
it work at all? How would we know if it works?

# The Proof

Yes, the problem was likely that the GPS coordinates were cached,
which is to say, a new note was posted using old location information
before the phone could determine its new location information. GPS
can be finicky. It's happened to me before.

But all theories aside, the way to find out was to try it. So I
posted [a note](http://link2.plnkx.com/id/33d3158a80b7de1269932cada1438157a27049e6)
and waited for them to catch up to their itinerary.

Five days later, half-way around the world, they arrived at the
hotel. I had no way of knowing.

Then I got this email:

<div style="padding: .5em; margin: 1em;
     background-color: #d2d6d7; font-family: sans, Arial;
     font-family: 'Libre Baskerville';" >

<div style='float: right;'>[05/27/2015]</div>

Just noticed your note from the hotel park Victoria. Ha ha.<br />
I'll share.<br />

Gorgeous hike today. 14 km.
Not too much uphill cause they took us up by bus.<br />
Lots of downhill. Sore feet.

The plnkx app is currently in BETA release.

But it *works*!

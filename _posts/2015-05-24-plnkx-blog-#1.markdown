# What is plnkx?

The word 'plnkx' is a rough contraction of *internet place link*.
There is also a plnkx Android app, and a
[plnkx.com](http://www.plnkx.com) website.

# What's an internet place link?

An internet place link is a location-based, digital *post-anywhere-note*.


## Digital

*Digital* means it lives on the web, just like your email.

## Location-based

*Location-based* means it's tied to a specific location, for example, your home address -- except that instead of using your street address to identify the location it uses your phone's GPS coordinates.

## Post-Anywhere-Notes

Your message or note is like a digital cairn that can be plopped down anywhere there are GPS coordinates: outside your house, on the Grand Coulee dam, at your favorite restaurant, on the White House lawn. 


The plnkx app is currently in BETA release.

The word 'plnkx' is a rough contraction of *internet place link*.

## What's an internet place link?

An internet place link is a location-based, digital *post-anywhere-note*.

## Digital

*Digital* means it lives on the web, just like your email.

## Location-based

*Location-based* means it's tied to a specific location, for example,
your home address &mdash; except that instead of using your street address
to identify the location it uses your browser or smart phone's GPS
coordinates.

## Post-Anywhere-Notes

Your message or note is like a digital cairn that can be plopped down
anywhere there are GPS coordinates: outside your house, on the Grand
Coulee dam, at your favorite restaurant, on the White House lawn.

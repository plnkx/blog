# My Favorite

There's nothing unusual or even exotic about my favorite note. In
fact it's quit plain, pedestrian even, by design.

It began with developing the app.

Week nights I'd code. Week days I'd drive to work, to my day
job.

First, there was my standard parking place. Maybe we're not all
creatures of habit, but I am. I park in the same spot every day.

# A pedestrian proof of concept

So I'd leave home, drive to the office, park in my spot, and if all
went well, my phone would buzz. Another successful plnkx app test!

But not always.

Sometimes I'd inadvertently broken the app the night before, or the
server was down, or there were too many clouds in the sky for my
phone to get a decent signal. Lots of things can go wrong.

But mostly, things went well. I was making progress. So I posted
another note for me to 'find' as I walked from my car to the office.

I'd drive to work, get a buzz at my regular parking spot, get out, and
walk towards the office. Halfway there another note would pop-up. The
note read:

```
Too late to turn back now?
```

Well, maybe. And maybe not! Changes in management at the time made me
wonder if maybe I should.

# Make something people want

At any rate, the daily success of those two notes (one while parking,
one while walking) increased my confidence in the value of the idea.
Sadly, work-life was still questionable.

So I posted another note right by the door. At the time, it was
my little secret.

And from then on -- every day if I was lucky -- I'd drive in to work
and walk and walk and then right before I got to the door... my phone
would buzz. I'd smile and look down at my phone.

I knew what to expect. Anticipation was half the fun. It was
something I wanted.

# Dante's Inferno

The title of the note by the door: [_Dante's Inferno_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_%28Dante%29).

'Inferno' (Italian for "Hell") is the first part of Dante Alighieri's
14th-century epic poem _Divine Comedy_.

My one-line note is nothing more than that famous phrase:

```
"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here."
```

It brings a smile to my face, even today. No matter how many dozens
of times I've seen it.

Everyone should go into work with a smile on their face. Don't you
think?

The plnkx app is currently in BETA release.

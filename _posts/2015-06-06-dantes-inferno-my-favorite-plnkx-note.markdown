# My Favorite note

There's nothing unusual or even exotic about my favorite note. In
fact it's quit plain, pedestrian even, by design.

It began with developing the app.

Week nights I'd code. Week days I'd drive to work, to my day
job. I park in the same spot every day, so that's where the
first note went. I'd pull into my spot, and my phone would buzz.
Another successful plnkx app test!

But not always.

Sometimes I'd inadvertently broken the app the night before, or the
server was down, or there were too many clouds in the sky for my
phone to get a decent signal. Lots of things can go wrong.

But mostly, things went well. I was making progress. So I posted
another note for me to 'find' as I walked from my car to the office.

That extended my daily testing: drive to work, wait for the buzz at
my regular parking spot, then walk towards the office; halfway there
another note appears:

```
"Too late to turn back now?"
```

Well, maybe. And maybe not! Changes in management at the time made me
wonder if maybe I should.

# Make something people want

At any rate, the daily success of those two types of notes (walking
and parking) increased my confidence in the value of the idea. Sadly,
work-life was still questionable.

So I posted another note by the door. At the time, it was
my little secret.

From then on -- every day if I was lucky -- I'd drive to work and get
out of my car and walk and walk until I got to the door where my
phone would *buzz* -- telling me there were notes in play.

I'd smile and look down at my phone. I knew what to expect.
Anticipation was half the fun. It was something I wanted.

# Italian for Hell

The title of the note: [_Dante's Inferno_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_%28Dante%29).

The note reads:

```
"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here."
```

It brings a smile to my face, even today.

Everyone should go into work with a smile on their face. Don't you
think?

The plnkx app is currently in BETA release.

What else can it do?

# Focus group feedback

Feedback at a meeting from our 'focus group' (i.e., friends at a
weekend party) told us three things.

# 1. Make it more like a note

First, make it obvious that plnkx is all about _notes_. I thought
that was already painfully obvious, but apparently not.

To that end, the home page now sports the
"<a href='/2015/11/12/im-a-plnkx-note.html'>I'm a plnkx note</a>" graphic.

<img src='/images/yellow_plnkx_note.jpg'
     style='margin-left: 4em; max-width: 30%;'
     title="I'm a plnkx note"
     alt="I'm a plnkx note" />

# 2. Change the name

Second, change the name. Well... probably won't

# 3. Don't make me work

Third, don't make me work. The idea of pressing _check,_ _check_,
_check_, or _view_, _view_, _view_ to look for notes, is too much.

"I don't want to have to do anything. I just want to turn it on and
have it tell me."

Why did we abandon the Android app?

Because you don't need it if you have a browser-based 'app'. All you
need is a browser on your smart phone. And every smart phone comes
with a browser. Problem solved! But the drawback was that you then
have to press the
<span style='background-color: #216d99; padding-left: .5em; padding-right:
.5em; color: #ffffff;'>Check</span> button (now the
<a
href='http://www.plnkx.com/view.jsp?init=yes'><span
style='background-color: #42e065; padding-left: .5em; padding-right:
.5em; color: #ffffff;'>View</span></a> button) to go looking for notes.

"I don't want to have to do anything."

Got it.

# The app is back

So the original Android app is back. (For now <a
href='https://www.plnkx.com/view.jsp?init=yes'>iPhone</a>
users still have to 
<a
href='http://www.plnkx.com/view.jsp?init=yes'><span
style='background-color: #42e065; padding-left: .5em; padding-right:
.5em; color: #ffffff;'>View</span></a>. Sorry.)

And I have to say, I like it. The latest version of the app has some
improved battery-usage algorithms, which means it uses less smart
phone juice. But the coolest part is: you don't have to
do anything. Just turn it on and it let's you know when there's a
note in sight.

Sweet.

Do you have feedback? If so, let us know.

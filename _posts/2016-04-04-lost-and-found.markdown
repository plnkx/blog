## Motorcycle day-trip

Two guys on a motorcycle day-trip pull into the parking lot at
Multnomah Falls, Oregon.

We find a purse on the ground. It rained the night before and the
purse is wet. Obviously it's been there for a while.

No money inside. But lots of ID. Driver's license. Birth certificate!
Personal letter from a loved one. The photo is blurry but she looks
like a young Asian woman.

There is no where to turn in the purse, so we take it with us as we
hike up to the falls.

## A young Asian woman
On the way up we ask the few young Asian-looking women we pass
if they lost their purse in the parking lot. None of them have.

Later over coffee we find her on FaceBook. Or at least we think it's
her.

I post a message: Did you lose your purse at Multnomah Falls? We found
one with your name in it.

She replies to the message.

A day later my friend meets her at Tower Books and returns her lost purse.
Only a few words are exchanged.

"Here's your purse."

"Thanks."

We didn't post a plnkx note at Multnomah Falls saying a purse was
found. But we could have.

In the future that might be the best way to report a found item, and
to find a lost one.

## Good ideas are not enough

But plnkx has yet to reach critical mass. It's still in the good idea
stage.

In short, the [lost purse](http://link2.plnkx.com/id/8abd165b66c36cddbd112c62bf7d68baca9b28c) was a plnkx fail.

We soldier on.

<sup>1</sup>A note to [angel investors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_investor). We previously described plnkx as a
"self-funded, internet-startup" based in Seattle. We're still in
Seattle, but we're no longer reaching for that *internet-startup*
brass ring. We plan to remain self-funded for the foreseeable future.

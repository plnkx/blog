<sup>1</sup>A note to [angel investors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_investor). Previously we described plnkx as a
"self-funded, internet-startup" based in Seattle, WA. We're still in
Seattle, but no longer reaching for that *internet-startup* brass ring.
We plan to remain self-funded for the foreseeable future. We are our
own portfolio.

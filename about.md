_plnkx_ is the name for the website and technology that makes the
idea of *post-anywhere notes* possible. For a brief explanation of how
post-anywhere notes work, see
[What is plnkx?](http://blog.plnkx.com/2015/05/24/plnkx-blog-%231.html)
Why do we care about
post-anywhere notes? See
[Why plnkx](http://blog.plnkx.com/2015/09/05/why-plnk.html)
for a hint at the possible future.

might also be worth your time.

Plnkx Incorporated is a small (one might even say *tiny*)
business<sup>1</sup> based in Seattle, WA. With no full-time
employees and no outside funding, it's a
labor of love â€” which is part of why we think it'll work.

plnkx is currently in beta release.

<sup>1</sup>A note to angel investors. Previously we described
ourselves as a "self-funded, internet-startup" based in Seattle, WA.
We're still in Seattle, but no longer reaching for an
*internet-startup* brass ring. We plan to remain self-funded for the
foreseeable future. We are our own portfolio.
